# 🚀 AWS Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

## 📘 Overview

This project leverages [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to provision and manage AWS infrastructure through Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It is built with scalability, reusability, and production-readiness in mind, supporting automation, collaboration, and version control.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
aws-terraform-infra/
├── backend.tf              # Remote backend configuration (S3 + DynamoDB)
├── main.tf                 # Core infrastructure resources
├── variables.tf            # Input variable declarations
├── outputs.tf              # Output definitions for cross-module or pipeline usage
├── .terraform.lock.hcl     # Provider dependency lock file
├── .gitignore              # Git exclusions (e.g., .terraform/, .tfstate files)
└── .terraform/             # Local working directory (auto-generated)
```

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools and configurations are in place:

- **Terraform CLI** (>= v1.0): [Download](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- **AWS CLI**: [Installation Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- **AWS Credentials**: Exported as environment variables or configured via `~/.aws/credentials`

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_key>
```

- **IAM Permissions**: Required to provision AWS infrastructure (e.g., EC2, S3, VPC)

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### 🔹 Initialize the Terraform Working Directory

```bash
terraform init
```

### 🔹 Validate Configuration Files

```bash
terraform validate
```

### 🔹 Generate and Review Execution Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 🔹 Apply Infrastructure Changes

```bash
terraform apply
```

## 🌐 Remote Backend

State management is configured in `backend.tf`, using **S3** for state storage and **DynamoDB** for state locking and consistency.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Ensure the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table exist prior to initialization and are secured via IAM policies.

---

## 📦 Variables & Outputs

- **`variables.tf`**: Define configurable parameters (e.g., region, environment, resource names)
- **`outputs.tf`**: Define outputs such as VPC IDs, public IPs, and other resource identifiers for use in other modules or CI/CD pipelines

> *Note: These files currently contain placeholders. Update them as your project scales.*

---

## 🏗️ Extensibility

This project is modular and built to scale:

- Multi-environment support via **Terraform workspaces** (e.g., dev, staging, prod)
- CI/CD pipeline compatibility (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
- Pluggable with custom or official **Terraform modules**
- Optional integration with **terratest** or **checkov** for automated testing

---

## 📌 State Management

Ensure consistency by managing your Terraform state remotely. Update the `backend.tf` file with appropriate values based on your AWS environment. Use secure IAM policies to restrict access.

---

## 🔧 Customization Guidelines

- **Add new resources** in `main.tf`
- **Define parameters** in `variables.tf`
- **Specify outputs** in `outputs.tf`
- Use module abstraction and naming conventions for reusability and clarity

---

## 🗃️ Version Control Best Practices

This project uses Git for source control. Sensitive and auto-generated files are excluded via `.gitignore`.

> 🔐 Avoid committing `.tfstate`, credentials, or any secrets to version control.

---

## 📄 Documentation & Architecture

For production readiness and enterprise adoption, consider including:

- Architecture diagrams (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart)
- Operational runbooks and playbooks
- Security and compliance guidelines
- Change and release management processes
